# 🥣 Api-Typed Framework

Opinionated TypeScript framework built on the shoulders of giants.

Api-Typed combines several popular librariers into one framework removing the overhead of setting up a new project and wiring things up together:

- [TypeDI](https://github.com/typestack/typedi) for a friendly dependency injection container
- [TypeORM](https://typeorm.io/) for convenient working with databases
- [Routing Controllers](https://github.com/typestack/routing-controllers) with [express](https://expressjs.com/) for declarative HTTP endpoints definition
- [Commander](https://github.com/tj/commander.js) for building CLI programs
- [winston](https://github.com/winstonjs/winston) for logging

Api-Typed ties these powerful tools together and exposes a convenient pluggable modules design with easy configuration.
